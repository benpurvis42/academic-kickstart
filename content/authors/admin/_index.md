I am a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Sheffield based within the School of Architecture. My research interests include system dynamics modelling, conceptualisation and operationalisation of 'urban sustainability', and how modelling and simulation is used to inform policy. My current research project focuses on how integrated assessment modelling may be used at the urban scale, using a prototype systems dynamics model based upon Meadows et al's 'World3'.
